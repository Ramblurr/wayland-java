/**
 * A single listener for Wayland signals
 * <p/>
 * {@code Listener} provides the means to listen for {@code wl_signal} notifications. Many
 * Wayland objects use {@code Listener} for notification of significant events like
 * object destruction.
 * <p/>
 * Clients should create {@code Listener} objects manually and can register them as
 * listeners to signals using #wl_signal_add, assuming the signal is
 * directly accessible. For opaque structs like wl_event_loop, adding a
 * listener should be done through provided accessor methods. A listener can
 * only listen to one signal at a time.
