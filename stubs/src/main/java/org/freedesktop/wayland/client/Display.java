/**
 * Represents a connection to the compositor and acts as a proxy to
 * the {@code Display} singleton object.
 * <p/>
 * A {@code Display} object represents a client connection to a Wayland
 * compositor. It is created with either {@code WlDisplayProxy.connect()} or
 * {@code WlDisplayProxy.connectToFd()}. A connection is terminated using
 * {@link #disconnect()}.
 * <p/>
 * A {@code Display} is also used as the {@link Proxy} for the {@code Display}
 * singleton object on the compositor side.
 * <p/>
 * A {@code Display} object handles all the data sent from and to the
 * compositor. When a {@link Proxy} marshals a request, it will write its wire
 * representation to the display's write buffer. The data is sent to the
 * compositor when the client calls {@link #flush()}.
 * <p/>
 * Incoming data is handled in two steps: queueing and dispatching. In the
 * queue step, the data coming from the display fd is interpreted and
 * added to a queue. On the dispatch step, the handler for the incoming
 * event set by the client on the corresponding {@link Proxy} is called.
 * <p/>
 * A {@code Display} has at least one event queue, called the <em>main
 * queue</em>. Clients can create additional event queues with \ref
 * {@link #createQueue()} and assign {@link Proxy}'s to it. Events
 * occurring in a particular proxy are always queued in its assigned queue.
 * A client can ensure that a certain assumption, such as holding a lock
 * or running from a given thread, is true when a proxy event handler is
 * called by assigning that proxy to an event queue and making sure that
 * this queue is only dispatched when the assumption holds.
 * <p/>
 * The main queue is dispatched by calling {@link #dispatch()}.
 * This will dispatch any events queued on the main queue and attempt
 * to read from the display fd if its empty. Events read are then queued
 * on the appropriate queues according to the proxy assignment. Calling
 * that function makes the calling thread the <em>main thread</em>.
 * <p/>
 * A user created queue is dispatched with {@link #dispatchQueue(EventQueue)}.
 * If there are no events to dispatch this function will block. If this
 * is called by the main thread, this will attempt to read data from the
 * display fd and queue any events on the appropriate queues. If calling
 * from any other thread, the function will block until the main thread
 * queues an event on the queue being dispatched.
 * <p/>
 * A real world example of event queue usage is Mesa's implementation of
 * {@code eglSwapBuffers()} for the Wayland platform. This function might need
 * to block until a frame callback is received, but dispatching the main
 * queue could cause an event handler on the client to start drawing
 * again. This problem is solved using another event queue, so that only
 * the events handled by the EGL code are dispatched during the block.
 * <p/>
 * This creates a problem where the main thread dispatches a non-main
 * queue, reading all the data from the display fd. If the application
 * would call <em> poll(2)</em> after that it would block, even though there
 * might be events queued on the main queue. Those events should be
 * dispatched with {@link #dispatchPending()} before
 * flushing and blocking.

     * This function dispatches events on the main event queue. It does not
     * attempt to read the display fd and simply returns zero if the main
     * queue is empty, i.e., it doesn't block.
     * <p/>
     * This is necessary when a client's main loop wakes up on some fd other
     * than the display fd (network socket, timer fd, etc) and calls
     * {@link #dispatchQueue(EventQueue)} from that callback. This may queue up
     * events in the main queue while reading all data from the display fd.
     * When the main thread returns to the main loop to block, the display fd
     * no longer has data, causing a call to {@code poll(2)} (or similar
     * functions) to block indefinitely, even though there are events ready
     * to dispatch.
     * <p/>
     * To proper integrate the wayland display fd into a main loop, the
     * client should always call {@code dispatchPending()} and then
     * {@link #flush()} prior to going back to sleep. At that point,
     * the fd typically doesn't have data so attempting I/O could block, but
     * events queued up on the main queue should be dispatched.
     * <p/>
     * A real-world example is a main loop that wakes up on a timerfd (or a
     * sound card fd becoming writable, for example in a video player), which
     * then triggers GL rendering and eventually eglSwapBuffers().
     * eglSwapBuffers() may call {@link #dispatchQueue(EventQueue)} if it didn't
     * receive the frame event for the previous frame, and as such queue
     * events in the main queue.

     * Use this function before polling on the display fd or to integrate

     * <p/>
     * There are two races here: first, before blocking in poll(), the fd
     * could become readable and another thread reads the events.  Some of
     * these events may be for the main queue and the other thread will
     * queue them there and then the main thread will go to sleep in
     * poll().  This will stall the application, which could be waiting
     * for a event to kick of the next animation frame, for example.
     * <p/>
     * The other race is immediately after poll(), where another thread
     * could preempt and read events before the main thread calls
     * {@link #dispatch()}.  This call now blocks and starves the other
     * fds in the event loop.
     * <p/>
     * A correct sequence would be:
     * <p/>
     * <pre>
     *   {@code
