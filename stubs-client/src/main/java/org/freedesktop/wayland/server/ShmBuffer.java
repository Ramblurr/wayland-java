     * Mark that the given SHM buffer is about to be accessed
     * <p/>
     * An SHM buffer is a memory-mapped file given by the client.
     * According to POSIX, reading from a memory-mapped region that
     * extends off the end of the file will cause a SIGBUS signal to be
     * generated. Normally this would cause the compositor to terminate.
     * In order to make the compositor robust against clients that change
     * the size of the underlying file or lie about its size, you should
     * protect access to the buffer by calling this function before
     * reading from the memory and call {@link #endAccess()}
     * afterwards. This will install a signal handler for SIGBUS which
     * will prevent the compositor from crashing.
     * <p/>
     * After calling this function the signal handler will remain
     * installed for the lifetime of the compositor process. Note that
     * this function will not work properly if the compositor is also
     * installing its own handler for SIGBUS.
     * <p/>
     * If a SIGBUS signal is received for an address within the range of
     * the SHM pool of the given buffer then the client will be sent an
     * error event when {@link #endAccess()} is called. If the signal
     * is for an address outside that range then the signal handler will
     * reraise the signal which would will likely cause the compositor to
     * terminate.
     * <p/>
     * It is safe to nest calls to these functions as long as the nested
     * calls are all accessing the same buffer. The number of calls to
     * wl_shm_buffer_end_access must match the number of calls to
     * {@code beginAccess()}. These functions are thread-safe and it
     * is allowed to simultaneously access different buffers or the same
     * buffer from multiple threads.
